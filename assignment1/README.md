In my marble program, I am representing the marbles as objects of the marble class I am creating. 

I will add marbles into the bag by appending the marble objects into the bag list. 
I will remove marbles by removing a marble from the bag list.
These actions will be methods included in the marble class. 

To test the program, I will add five marbles and pull them out at random and see if they still hold their values.
