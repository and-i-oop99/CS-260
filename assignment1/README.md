In my marble program, I am representing the marbles as objects of the marble class I am creating. 

I will add marbles into the bag by adding them to the array that represents the bag
I will remove marbles by removing the user's desired marbles from the bag


To test the program, I will add marbles and take away marbles and print the marbles in the bag to make sure it is working correctly.
